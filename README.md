## What?
Okay listen. I am diligent about my old project files, yet it is a nightmare to figure out where my files are located. I usually move everything to the same folder, but sometimes stuff slips through the cracks. This is a really simple way to see where those darn files are!

Completely local in your browser btw, trust.
